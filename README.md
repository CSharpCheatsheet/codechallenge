    OBJECTIVE - Become A Competitive C# Programmer
    

    ----------------------------------------------


    ‚Äú For me, great algorithms are the poetry of
      computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,
      allusive, dense, and even mysterious.

      But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new
      light on some aspect of computing. ‚Äù

    ‚Äî Francis Sullivan


    ----------------------------------------------


    ‚Äú An algorithm must be seen to be believed. ‚Äù

    ‚Äî Donald Knuth


    ----------------------------------------------


    ‚Äú I will, in fact, claim that the difference
    between a bad programmer and a good one is
    whether he considers his code or his data
    structures more important.

    Bad programmers worry about the code.

    Good programmers worry about data structures
    and their relationships. ‚Äù

    ‚Äî Linus Torvalds

    ‚Äú Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. ‚Äù

    Hi! I am Anit. I am an ever learning student
    of mathematics and computer science.

    I have worked for few years as a software
    development engineer and I believe that I
    have to keep myself skilled and updated. 
    
    So from time to time I go through the basics,
    i.e. data structures and algorithms to enhance
    my problem solving skills and keep myself 
    competitive.

    Furthermore, to keep myself updated in this
    technology I need to follow the advancements
    by trying out the changes on hand.

    Hence, the objective of this repository is
    personal growth and development of 
    programming skills.

    The repository contains the code challenges
    and their solutions from different sources.
    It also includes implementation of basic data
    structures and algorithms in C#.

    Books and other resources are in the 
    Resource folder.

    Code challenges solutions from different 
    sources are in the CodeChallenge folder.

    online resources free, and especially Robert
    Sedgewick & Kevin Waynefor excellent contents.

    Recently came to know about a playlist on 
    Algorithms by Abdul Bari on YouTube. I am 
    very thankful to his effort on making very
    hard things easy to understand.
